## About
This is a cloned version of my project, `FindYourOnlys`. The purpose of this clone is to showcase what I have learned since I graduated from AppWorks School. Currently it only includes pets adoption lists and detail scenes. If you would like to see the original version, please refer to the link as below.

## Design decision
### Test suite
Implemented test-driven-development to ensure that all behaviors worked as intended. This includes unit tests and integration tests to cover components' behavior in isolation and collaboration between components.
* Moved infrastructure integration tests (network/database) into separate targets and only run them in continueous delivery pipeline (`CI` scheme) to keep the feedback of the test suite as fast as possible. 
 
### System design
* Implemented modular system by creating feature (business), UI, API and Cache layers and composing them in the app layer (composition). This way, they can be separated into different modules if needed.

**Feature layer (Business logic)**
* Defined feature abstraction components instead of concrete types. This way, the system can be more flexible when facing requirements changes by creating different implementations of the abstraction and composing them differently without altering the existed components.  
* Also, it allows development can be proceeded in parallel. For instance, once team decides the definition of the `PetImageDataLoader` abstration, UI, API and Cache layer can be developed in parallel.

**UI layer (Includes Presentation layer)**
* Implemented MVVM as UI architecture to separate iOS-specific components (import UIKit) from feature logic (platform-agnostic) by using platform-agnostic presentation components (ViewModel). This way, the ViewModel can be reused across platforms if needed.
* Used closure as binding strategy to achieve simplest way of binding. 
* Implemented multiple MVVMs in one scene to avoid components holding too many responsibilities (massive view controller).
* Used closure callback to send UIViewController navigation events to its client intead of creating another UIViewController within an UIViewController.

**API/Cache layer**
* Hid the infrastructure frameworks' details by depending on an infrastructure-specific abstraction. This way, I can easily switch the frameworks based on the needs without altering current system.
* Separated the frameworks' details from business logic also make the framework components easy to test, develop and maintain since it just obeys the command to save, load and delete data.
* Created layer-specific models to avoid leaking framework-specific logic into feature layer. For instance, avoiding feature model to conform `Decodable` protocol.

**App layer (Composition)**
* Acted as all layers' clients to initialize all components this application needs.
* Also composited, decorated components differently based on the requirements.
